		<p>Hi! My name is John Curran. Welcome to version one of my personal website. I am creating this website primarily out of a want to learn more about web programming. 
		I have a lot of great ideas that I will continually implement as I have time. I would also like to post some projects, both complete and in progress as a kind of showcase. 
		I currently work full time in the software industry, however, so my spare time is far from infinite.
		<p>I was born and raised in Indiana and still currently live in the state. I grew up on the far north side of Indianapolis, about 30 miles from Downtown Indy. 
		I completed all of my schooling in the Indianapolis area, where I attended Catholic Schools for middle school and high school. After high school, I went on to graduate with distinction from the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in computer engineering with minors in mathematics and computer science. 
		I was an award winning student in my senior year, earning awards 
		for my academic performance and my senior design project. I have always had a passion for technology. 
		A perfect illustration of this fact is when I tried to give the new family dog the name of "Computer" when I was about 5 years old.</p>
		<p>Outside of being an aspiring computer genius, I played football through grade school and high school, achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America, 
		went fishing on any body of water that I could get to, took apart, fixed, and rebuild everything with an engine, and learned everything I could along the way. I consider myself a true Jack of all trades. 
		If I don't know enough to immediately jump right into something, I usually know enough to at least hold a conversation and pick up the missing material very quickly from those more knowledgeable than myself.
